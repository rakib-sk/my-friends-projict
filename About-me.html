        My name is Md. Rakib. I am a student from Jhikargacha Upazila in Jessore district, Bangladesh. My village name is Barobapur. I studied in the vocational branch at M.L. School, focusing on the Building Trade. I have recently completed my SSC (Vocational) examination.
        <br><br>
        Since childhood, I have had a deep interest in technology. Currently, I am learning web development and have already completed many projects. I have basic knowledge of programming languages like Java, C, Python, and JavaScript. I want to pursue a Diploma in Computer Science in the future.
        <br><br>
        My dream is to become a skilled Software Engineer. Even though I donâ€™t have a personal computer, I continue coding using my phone. I take this challenge as my strength.
        <br><br>
        I regularly upload my projects to GitHub and always make sure the folder structure and file paths are correct before uploading. My main project folder is called "Your friend circle," and it includes separate folders for code and images.
        <br><br>
        I actively take part in scout activities which help me build leadership and teamwork skills. I also enjoy making fun videos with my friends and plan to start a YouTube channel in a few months.
        <br><br>
        I pray regularly and try to stay connected to my faith. I am also trying to improve my English speaking skills so I can express myself better in the international field.
        <br><br>
        My journey has just begun, but I believe with hard work, dedication, and trust in Allah, I will achieve my dreams and do something good for society.
